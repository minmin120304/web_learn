            <p>The rainbow lorikeet is a medium-sized parrot. The head is deep blue with a greenish-yellow nuchal collar, and the rest of the upper parts (wings, back, and tail) are deep green. The chest is red with blue-black barring. The belly is deep green, and the thighs and rump are yellow with deep green barring. In flight, a yellow wing-bar contrasts clearly with the red underwing coverts.</p>

            <p>There is little to visually distinguish between the sexes; however, to a keen observer of their coloring and behavior, their dimorphism is readily apparent.</p>
